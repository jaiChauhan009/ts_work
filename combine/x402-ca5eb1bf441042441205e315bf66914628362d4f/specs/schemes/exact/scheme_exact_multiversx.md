# Scheme: `exact:dharitri`

## Summary

This scheme facilitates payments on the DharitrI blockchain. It leverages DharitrI Relayed Transactions (v3) to provide a secure and user-friendly payment experience.

With Relayed Transactions, users do not need to possess the native gas token (EGLD) to make payments. The transaction fees are covered by the facilitator or the resource server.

Furthermore, this approach enhances security and trust. The transaction is signed by the user and then co-signed by the facilitator. This ensures that the resource server cannot unilaterally submit or alter the transaction. Only the facilitator, after verifying the conditions, can submit the transaction to the DharitrI network.

## Use Cases

- Paying for services or digital goods on platforms built on DharitrI.
- Enabling microtransactions where the cost of gas would be a significant barrier for users.
- Scenarios requiring an additional layer of trust and verification before a transaction is committed to the blockchain.
