# mx-sdk-js-web-wallet-cross-window-provider

Signing provider for dApps: Web Wallet Cross Window Provider. 

This package is part of the DharitrI SDK, which is a set of tools and libraries that allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the DharitrI blockchain.
By using this package, developers can integrate the DharitrI Web Wallet into their dApps, allowing users to sign transactions and messages with their DharitrI account.
The connection between the dApp and the Web Wallet is established through a cross-window communication channel, which is managed by the Web Wallet Cross Window Provider.

Documentation is available on [docs.dharitri.org](https://docs.dharitri.org/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-signing-providers/#the-web-wallet-cross-window-provider), while an integration example can be found [here](https://github.com/TerraDharitri/drt-js-sdk-examples/tree/main/signing-providers).

Note that **we recommend using [sdk-dapp](https://github.com/TerraDharitri/mx-sdk-dapp)** instead of integrating the signing provider on your own.
